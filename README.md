# raspigro
Raspberry Pi based greenhouse control suite
- Adapted from RasPiViv V 2.1, which was a free application that shutdown back in 2018 timeframe. Note: use the wayback machine to look up the archive: http://web.archive.org/web/20150215000000*/raspiviv.com as the original url is now pwned. It was licenced for general public use and this is my interpretation of that code and hardware configuration with some additional functions.

- Provides abilities to 
   - Set temperature of when the fan will turn on
   - Set watering zones enabled, time on/off and duration

- Requirements
   - Raspberry Pi
   - Relay hat or add on
   - Humidity/Temperature Sensors (DHT22)
   - Irrigation valves or assembly
   - Fan(s) of choice (120v/240v)
